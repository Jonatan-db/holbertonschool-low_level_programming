# What I learned from this project  
At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

**What are structures, when, why and how to use them?**  
*User defined data type. You can define them globally and declare elements in their scope to append. Access their traits or attributes with '.' notation or symbol. Eg. user.name, user.email, user.age. We can use pointers to structures. We can use stuff like \*(ptr).name. But the easier way is using -> so we can jsut do ptr->name.* 
*the -> is just using a dereferencing \* combined with a ,. so its 2 in 1. TECHNICAL DEFINITION IS. A struct is a composite data type that defines a grouped list of variables placed under one name in a block of memory and allows the different variables to be accessed with a single pointer. C structures directly references a contiguous block of physical memory and usually sizeof is used to allocate the correct size. Struct is taken from the ALGOL 68 structure data type. 3 ways to initialize a structure. We can forward declare by typing typedef struct blah to be a structure. We can declare the structure with its members. We can copy an existing object of same type.*  

**How to use typedef??**  
*It is a keyword. We use it to give a type and a new name. I can type "typedef unsigned float poop" and then do poop w; w = 9.69696. Its like a macro but with data types. We can typedef structures. 
WE CAN USE POINTERS AND DEREFERENCING AND ARROWS AND A WHOLE BUNCH WITH TYOPEDEF OH HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY.*  





## Each scripts and their output  
* Script 0 - Write a function that allocates memory using malloc.  
* Script 1 - Write a function that concatenates two strings.  
* Script 2 - Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.  
* Script 3 - Write a function that creates an array of integers.  
* Script 100 - Write a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free.  
* Script 101 - Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers.
