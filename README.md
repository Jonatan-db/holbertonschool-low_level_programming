### Introduction
___  
Each directory contains the low level projects and code that I wrote during my time at Holberton. More detailed and specific READMEs are located in each folder. The focus of these projects were to master computer science concepts and to practice the theory behind C, algorithms, and basic data structures.

### Capstone Projects  
___  
<a href="https://github.com/byn3/printf">printf</a>  

I wrote my own printf function with <a href="https://https://github.com/thenicopixie">Nicole Swanson</a>. This project had restrictions regarding the use of several functions and libraries, so my partner and I had to write our own functions that behaved similar to their standard counterparts. All of these files had to compile and work together to function as a printf substitute.
