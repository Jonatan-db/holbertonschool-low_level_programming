At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

How to use the exit function
yea i did. exit witn an int parameter with the status
 exit success and exit fail are macros. use exit to quit a program and go back into the OS

What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them
calloc allocates memory of an array so its like malloc but nicer. it is called via calloc(int,sizeof(datatype) and realloc reallocates more memory. we can pass the pointer and th new size we want like realloc(*pointer, 25);

found my info online and the man pages of exit calloc and realloc
