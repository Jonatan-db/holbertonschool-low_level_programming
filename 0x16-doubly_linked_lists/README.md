**How to use doubly linked lists?**  
*Like a singly linked list but it also links to previous*  


## Each scripts and their output  
* Script 0 - Write a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.  
* Script 1 - Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.  
* Script 2 - Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.  
* Script 3 - Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.  
* Script 4 - Write a function that free a dlistint_t list.  
* Script 5 - Write a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.  
* Script 6 - Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.  
* Script 7 - Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.  
* Script 8 - Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list.  
* Script 102 - Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
